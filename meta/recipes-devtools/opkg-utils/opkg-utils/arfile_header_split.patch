Subject: ipkg-utils: Make arfile.py handle six digit UIDs
    
    Essentially, the problem is that arfile.py is splitting the ar header with
    white-space instead of fixed-width fields, so two fields would get treated
    as a single field.  This makes things better than before as it now honors
    the fixed field widths.
    
Upstream-Status: Pending (there is no upstream after openmoko imploded)
